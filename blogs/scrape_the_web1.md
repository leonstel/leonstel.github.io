# Scraping the Web

For a while now the possibilities of machine learning have fascinated me. Though I was doing some for fun on the side I 
have decided too take it more seriously. By chance, with that thought in my mind, I have came across the company [Springco](https://www.spring-co.nl/) which
uses machine learning to get answers for urban related questions. 

After an inspiring conversation with Hank Groenhof and RenÃ© Neijmeijer covering topics such as the steps taken
to get to an answer, statistics, neural nets and lastly how and where to get your data. It got me thinking.  

*Questions I am going to answer*

**What specific data do you want?**  
**How do you harvest data from a website if no off the shelf api exists?**    
**How do you want to store it and in which format?**  
**How could a data scientist use the harvested data?**

## Use Case - Sports Betting

Because I used to play badminton in the previous days and have scoured the tournament website a lot for keeping track of 
matches I thought it would be fun to use that as a base for this case. It would have saved me a lot of time then if I had a
web scraper doing all the searching for me ðŸ˜ƒ.

Recently sport betting is becoming legal in the united stated. Imagine that you are the owner of a sports club and 
wants to make some extra money. Your objective is: 

- Getting insights if betting on the tournaments held at my club is profitable
 
 
I want a collection of tournaments, players and games.
I have searched the web but no api is available for this kind of data.




Want tournament data but no API exists. How do you harvest that data and in which format
