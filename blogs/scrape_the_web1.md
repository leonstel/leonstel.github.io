For a while now the possibilities of machine learning have fascinated me. Though I was doing some for fun on the side I 
have decided too take it more seriously. By chance, with that thought in my mind, I have came across the company [Springco](https://www.spring-co.nl/) which
uses machine learning to get answers for urban related questions. 

After an inspiring conversation with Hank Groenhof and Ren√© Neijmeijer covering topics such as the steps taken
to get to an answer, statistics, neural nets and lastly how and where to get your data. It got me thinking.  

*Questions I am going to answer*

**What specific data do you want?**
**How do you harvest data from a website if no off the shelf api exists?**    
**How do you want to store it and in which format?**  
**How could a data scientist use the harvested data?**

## Use Case

Want tournament data but no API exists. How do you harvest that data and in which format

[https://www.toernooi.nl](https://www.toernooi.nl/)

to database
